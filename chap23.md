**MISC**

several ways a species might acquire new genetic variation. These include mutations within pre-existing genes, gene duplications that produce gene families, and horizontal gene transfer.

 The discovery of fishapod illuminates one of several steps that led to the evolution of tetrapods, which are animals with four legs. T. roseae is called 

Darwin went on the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836. The goal of the trip was to make oceanic measurements ;

the book that describes Darwins adventures is On the Origin of Species (1859)

Darwin expressed this concept of evolution as “the theory of descent with modification through variation and natural selection.”
**NAMES**

**John Ray**: developed an early classification system for plants and animals based on anatomy and physiology. He established the modern concept of a species, noting that organisms of one species do not interbreed with members of another

**Georges Buffon**:A French zoologist that actually proposed that populations of living things change through time.

**Georges Cuvier**: Proposed Catastrophism to explain the age of the earth; 

Alternatively, uniformitarianism, proposed by Scottish geologist **James Hutton** and popularized by another Scottish geologist, **Charles Lyell**, suggested that changes in the Earth are directly caused by recurring events

**John Gould**, helped Darwin specifiying that all the types of birbs he saw were different types of the same finch.

Tiktaalik roseae, nicknamed fishapod, were discovered by paleontologists **Ted Daeschler, Neil Shubin, and Farish Jenkins**.


**DEFNITIONS**

**evolution**: The phenomenon that populations and organisms change from one generation to the next ;

**molecular evolution**: crefers to changes in the genetic material that underline changes in characteristics or phenotypes ; 

**microevolution**: Changes in a populations gene pool, or in allele frequencies, from generation to generation ;

**macroevolution**: Evolutionary change that create new species and groups of species ;

**transitional form**: an organism that provides a link between earlyer and later forms in evolution ;

**Biogeography**: the study of the geographic distribution of extinct and living species ;

**endemic**: term to describe organisms that are naturally only found only in a particular location ;

**convergent evolution**: the process whereby two different species from different lineages show similar characteristics because they occupy similar enrironments ;

**analogous structure or convergent traits**: structure that is a result of convergent evolution. They arrise because the species that attain them occupy similar environments on the Earth ;

**homologous structures**: Structures that are similar to eachother because they are derived from the same ancestral structure ;

**vestigial structure**: an anatomical feautre that has no apparent function but resembles a structure of a presumes ancestor ;

**homologous genes**: genes derived from the same ancestral gene that have accumulated random mutations that make their sequence slightly different ;

**ortholog**: a homologous gene in different species ;

**paralog**: homologous genes within a sigle species ;




**TYPES OF EVIDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION**

1. Studies of natural selection: by following characteristics of population over time, researchers have observed how natural selection alters populations in response to environmental changes ;
2. Fossil record: When fossils are compared according to their age, from oldest to youngest, successive evolutionary change becomes apparent ;
3. biogeography: Unique species found on islands and other remote areas hace arisen because the species in these location have evolved in isolation from ther rest of the world ;
4. convergent evolution: Two different species from different lineages sometimes become anatomically similar because they occupy similar environments. this indicates that natural selection results in adaptation to a given environment.
5. selective breeding: the traits in domesticates species have been profoundly modified by selective breeding in which breeders choose the parents that have desirable traits ;
6. Homologies:
   1. Anatomical: Homologous structures are structures that are anatomically similar to each other because they evolved from a structure in a common ancestor. In some cases, such structures have lost their original function and become vestigial ;
   2. Developmental: An analysis of embryonic development often reveals similar features that point to past evolutionary relationships ;
   3. Molecular
