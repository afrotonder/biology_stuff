**MISC INFO**


At the end of the Permian period, the largest known mass extinction in the history of life on Earth occurred; 90â€“95% of marine species and a large proportion of terrestrial species were eliminated.

the closest modern relative to eukaryotes is thought to be a phylum of archaea called Lokiarchaeota, which carries many genes that are hypothesized to play a role in membrane remodeling. 

Due to **continental drift**, the continents have been moving over the last billion years.

the earth is estiated to be 4.55 billion

to understand the origin or life, we can view the process as occurring in four overlapping stages:

	st1: Nucleotides and amino acids were produced prior to the existence of cells ;

	st2: Nucleotides became polymerized to from RNA and/or DNA, and amino acids became polymerized to form proteins ;

	st3: Polymers became enclosed in membranes ;
	
	st4: Polymers enclosed in membreanes acquired cellular properties ;

**Pre life theories:**
1. Reducing Atmosphere Hypothesis 
2. Extraterrestrial Hypothesis
3. Deep-sea Vent Hypothesis



Most fossils are formed when organisms are buried quickly, and then during the process of sedimentary rock formation, their hard parts are gradually replaced over millions of years by minerals, producing a recognizable representation of the original organism (


A common way to estimate the age of a fossil s by analyzing the decay or radioisotopes within the accompanying rocks, a process called **radiometric dating**.
For dating geological materials, several types of isotope decay patterns are particularly useful: carbon to nitrogen, potassium to argon, rubidium to strontium, and uranium to lead 

**NAMES**

1. **Miller and Urey**: simulated early earths atmosphere. believed in the __***Reducing Atmosphere Hypothesis***__
2. in 1992, American geobiologist **Joseph Kirschvink** proposed the snowball Earth hypothesis, which suggests that the Earth was entirely covered by ice during parts of the period from 790 to 630 mya

many scientist in the 50's proposed that the early Earth's atmosphere
was rich in **water vapor(H2O)**, **hydrogen gas(H2)**, **methane(CH4)**, and
**ammonia(NH3)**

**DEFINITIONS**

**prebiotic soup**: the medium formed by the slow accumulation of organic
molecules in the early oceans over a long period of time prior to 
the existance of life ;

**probiont**: nonliving structures that evolved into linving cells. Aggregate of prebiotically produced molecules and macromolecules with a boundary to separate its internal chemical environment from its surroundings ;

**Coacervates**: droplets that form spontaneously from the association of charged polymers such as proteins, carbohydrates, or nucleic acids surrounded by water ;

**liposome**: vesicle surrounded by a lipid bilayer ;

**chemical selection**: occurs when a chemical within a 
mixture has special properties or advantages that cause 
it to increase in amount ;

**geological timescale**: timeline of Earths history from its origin about 4.5 bya to the present ;

**zoic**: animal life ;

**heterotroph**: Organisms that cannot produce their own organic molecules and must obtain organic food from other organisms ;

**autotroph**: an organism that has metabolic pathways that use energy from either inorganic molecules or light to make organic molecules ;

**stromatolite**: a layered calcium carbonate structure in an aquatic environment, generally produced by cyanobacteria ;

**endosymbiotic**: describes a relationship in which one organism lives inside the other ;


<h2> The Geological Timescale </h2>

This timeline is divided into 4 eons: **Hadean**, **Archaean**, **Proterozoic**, and **Phanerozoic**

The <u>**Precambrian**</u> is composed of:
<ol>
	<li>Hadean Eon: 
		<ul>
			<li>pokaryotic cells appeared (end, <b>3.8-3.5 bya</b>)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Archaean Eon: 
		<ul>
			<li>fossils of primitive cyanobacteria(early, <b>3.5 bya</b>)</li>
			<li>eukaryotic cells appear(late,<b>1.8 bya</b> )</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Proterozoic Eon
		<ul>
			<li>multicellular eukaryotic organisms firs appear(middle, 		<b>1.5 bya</b>)</li>
			<li>first animals appear(late, <b>632 mya</b>)</li>
			<li>bilateral invertebrate animals first appear(late, <b>590 mya</b>)</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>

</ol>

The <u>**Cambrian**</u> is the geological 'era' in which the diversity of life saw a rapid increase. it takes place in the **Phanerozoic Eon**;
