**MISC**

interspecies breeding leads to polyploidy when interbreeding species are also polyploid ;

biologists often compare DNA sequences of genes, gene or    der along chromosomes, chromosome structure, and chromosome number in order to identify similarities and differences among different populations

Postzygotic isolating mechanisms tend to be uncommon in nature compared with prezygotic mechanisms.

The most commonly used characteristics for identifying species are morphological traits, the ability to interbreed, molecular features, ecological factors, and evolutionary relationships. sud

Currently, about 1.8 million species have been identified and catalogued.

Common estimates of the total number of species range from 5 to 50 million!

the moest prevalent way of cladogenesis is allopatric speciation ;
**NAMES**

study done by American biologist **E. O. Wilson** and colleagues in 1990 estimated the known number of species at approximately 1.4 million

In the late 1920s, geneticist **Theodosius Dobzhansky** proposed that each species is reproductively isolated from other species.

Ernst Mayr proposed one of the first species concepts, called the biological species concept
**DEFINITIONS**

**evolutionary developmental biology**: is an exciting and relatively new field of biology that compares the development of different organisms in an attempt to understand ancetral relationships between organisms and the developmental mechanisms that bring about evolutionary change ;
**gradualism** : concept suggesting that species evolve continuously over long spans of time ;
**cladogenesis**: a pattern of speciation in which a species is divided into two or more species 

**sympatric speciation**: a form of speciatin that occurs when member of a species that initially occupy the same habitat within the same range diverge into two or more different species ;
<ul> happens in one of two ways: 
    <li><b>Polyploidy</b>: A type of genetic change that can cause immediate reproductive isolation is polyploidy, in which an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes</li>
</ul>
<b>allopareic speciation</b> : a form of speciation that occurs when a population becomes geographycally isolated from other populations and evolves into one or more new species ;

**specieation**: the formatin o a new species ;

**subspecies**:  a subdivision of a species ; this designation is used when two or more geographycally restricted groups of the same species differ, ut not enough to warrant their placement into separate species ;

**ecotypes**: genetically distinct populations adapted to their local environments ;

**reproductive isolation**: refers to the conceot that a species cannot successfully interbreed with other species ;

**reproductive isolation mechanisms**: mechanisms that prevent interbreeding between different species ;

**prezygotic isolation mechanism**: a mechanism that stops interbreeding by oreventing the formation of a zygote ;
<ul>
    <li>habitat isolation: species occupy different habitats, so they never come in contact with eachother ; </li>
    <li>temporal isolation: species have different mating or flowering seasons or times of day or become sexually mature af different times of year ; </li>
    <li>behavioral isolation: sexual attraction between males and females of different animal species is limited due to differences in behaviour or physiology ; </li>
</ul>

**postzygotic isolation mechanism**: a mechanism that prevents interbreeding by blocking the development of a variable and fertile individual after fertilization has taken place ;
<ul>
    <li> hybrid inviability</li>
    <li>hybrid sterility</li>
    <li>hybrid breakdown</li>

<h3><b class="blink_me" >Ecological Species Concept</b> A third example is the ecological species concept, described by American evolutionary biologist <b>Leigh Van Valen</b> in 1976. According to this viewpoint, each species occupies an ecological niche, which is the unique set of habitat resources that a species requires, as well as its influence on the environment and other species.</h3>


<h3><b class="blink_me">General Lineage Concept</b>  Most evolutionary biologists would agree that different methods are needed to distinguish the vast array of species on Earth. Even so, some evolutionary biologists have questioned whether it is valid to have many different species concepts. In 1998, American zoologist Kevin de Queiroz suggested that there is only a single general species concept, which concurs with Simpson’s evolutionary lineage concept and includes all previous concepts. According to de Queiroz’s general lineage concept, each species is a population of an independently evolving lineage. Each species has evolved from a specific series of ancestors and, as a consequence, forms a group of organisms with a particular set of characteristics. Multiple criteria are used to determine if a population is part of an independent evolutionary lineage, and thus a species, which is distinct from others. Typically, researchers use analyses of morphology, reproductive isolation, DNA sequences, and ecology to determine if a population or group of populations is distinct from others. Because of its generality, the general lineage concept has received significant support.

<h3><b class="blink_me">Biological Species Concept </b>
 Ernst Mayr proposed one of the first species concepts, called the biological species concept. According to Mayr’s concept, a species is a group of individuals whose members have the potential to interbreed with one another in nature to produce viable, fertile offspring but cannot successfully interbreed with members of other species. The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation as the most important criterion for delimiting species.

<h3><b class="blink_me">Evolutionary Lineage Concept </b>
 Another example of a species concept is the evolutionary lineage concept proposed by American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson in 1961. A lineage is a series of species that forms a line of descent, with each new species the direct result of speciation from an immediate ancestral species. According to Gaylord, species should be defined based on the separate evolution of lineages.
